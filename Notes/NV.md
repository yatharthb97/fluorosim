We don't need to worry about the Navier-Stokes Equations as ... TK
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$
The velocities in the neighboring areas of fluid  cannot have an inward or outward flow. These regions, if they exist, represent sinks and sources. (Mass is conserved in the fluid.)
$$
\rho \frac{du}{dt} = -\nabla P + \mu \nabla^{2}u + \rho \mathbf{F}
$$
First term describes a pressure gradient. The second term explains the viscosity and the third the flow due to external forces.

These equations provide the **specification, not the implementation**.





Under turbulent conditions → large number of eddies are present. This eddies further aid the passive diffusion process by introducing active forces into the system — turbulent diffusion or eddy diffusion. This process is much faster than passive transport in normal diffusion.
